# 💧 Smart Water Dispenser using Arduino Uno

A simple and efficient automated water dispensing system using an **HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** and an **Arduino Uno**. The project aims to reduce water wastage and provide a touchless user experience, making it ideal for homes, offices, and public places.

## 📋 Materials Required

- 🔌 **Arduino Uno** (any version)
- 📏 **HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- ⚡ **5V Relay**
- 🔄 **12V DC Motor**
- 🔋 **12V Adapter**
- 🔗 **Breadboard**
- 🔌 **Connecting Wires**

## ⚙️ Working Concept

The concept behind the **Smart Water Dispenser** is simple yet effective:

- The **HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** detects any object placed near the dispenser (e.g., a glass).
- Once the object is detected within a set distance, the system automatically triggers the **DC motor** using a **5V relay**.
- The motor pumps water into the glass until the object is removed or the filling time is completed.
- The entire process is automated and eliminates the need for manual switching, ensuring hygiene and reducing water wastage.

## 🌍 Impact of the Project

- ✅ **Water Conservation**: Reduces water wastage through precise dispensing.
- ✅ **Hygiene**: Contactless operation minimizes the risk of contamination.
- ✅ **Energy Efficient**: Consumes minimal power due to the use of efficient components.
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: Built using affordable and easily available materials.
- ✅ **Customizable**: Detection range and motor run-time can be adjusted for different container sizes.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 💡 Integration with IoT for real-time water usage monitoring.
- 🔋 Solar-powered setup for eco-friendly operation.
- 📱 Mobile app to control the dispenser remotely.
- 🔊 Audio or visual indicators for low water levels.

## 🔌 How to Run the Project

1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the setup using a 12V adapter.
4. Place a glass near the sensor—water will automatically dispense into the glass.
